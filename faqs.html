                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Coffee Makers</h2>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>1. What type of coffee maker is best for beginners?</h3>
                    <p>For beginners, a drip coffee maker or single-serve machine is often the easiest to use. These machines are affordable, easy to set up, and produce good quality coffee with minimal effort.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>2. Can I make espresso with a regular coffee maker?</h3>
                    <p>Regular coffee makers do not have the pressure needed to brew espresso. However, you can use a stovetop espresso maker (Moka pot) or an espresso machine for true espresso-style coffee.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>3. How do I clean my coffee maker?</h3>
                    <p>To clean your coffee maker, follow these steps: 
                        1. Empty the coffee grounds. 
                        2. Run a mixture of water and white vinegar through a brewing cycle.
                        3. Rinse thoroughly with clean water.
                        This will help remove any coffee oils and mineral buildup.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>4. Why is my coffee maker brewing weak coffee?</h3>
                    <p>Weak coffee can be the result of too little coffee grounds, using water that's too cold, or the coffee maker needing a thorough cleaning. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's recommended coffee-to-water ratio and clean your machine regularly.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>5. How long do coffee makers typically last?</h3>
                    <p>The lifespan of a coffee maker depends on the brand and how often it is used. On average, a coffee maker can last between 5 to 10 years with proper maintenance.</p>
