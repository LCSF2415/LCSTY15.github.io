            <h2>Why Coffee is Great for You!</h2>
            <p>
                Did you know that coffee is packed with antioxidants? These natural compounds help fight 
                inflammation and protect your cells from damage. Coffee can boost your focus, enhance your mood, 
                and energize your day, making it a staple for both homes and workplaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you’re starting your morning at home or keeping your team energized throughout the day, 
                CoffeeCraft is here to bring the art of brewing to your kitchen or café. Elevate every sip with 
                us today!
