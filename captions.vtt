1
00:02.000 --> 00:05.000
All right, so I'm having the first espresso of the day and I'm here

2
00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
at Becerraca in Brno, where our friend Tommy,

3
00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
who is a skilled barista and also co-owner of the place, will explain,

4
00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
prepare, and show you all the espresso drinks on the menu.

5
00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
So check it out.

6
00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
We'll break down all espresso drinks into two categories:

7
00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Black coffee and milk coffee.

8
00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
In black coffee, we will talk about single espresso, double espresso,

9
00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
americano, lungo, and filter coffee.

10
00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
In milk coffee, we will talk about macchiato, cortado or piccolo,

11
00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
flat white, cappuccino, and café latte.

12
00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
The names vary a lot around the world, and recipes are not set in stone.

13
00:41.000 --> 00:49.000
But this overview should be a good starting point for you.

14
00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
All right, so today we'll be talking about coffee—most of the coffees

15
00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
that are made on this machine, the espresso machine.

16
00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
And we'll start perhaps with the basic but the most important one, and that's espresso.

17
00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
So, Tommy, are you ready? Let's make espresso.

18
01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
I'm ready. Let's do it.

19
01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
**Single Espresso**: A single shot or just an espresso is served in a small cup.

20
01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
As you can see, there are actually two espresso shots being produced at a time, each from one spout.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
The volume is usually around 20 to 30 milliliters or grams,

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
because we prefer to weigh coffee.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
In our case, it's 21 grams.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
It's a very intense, concentrated beverage with a rich taste and smooth structure.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Before you drink it, it's good to stir it so all the layers mix before you taste it.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
If you want to drink a little more coffee but with the same intensity, just order a double espresso or espresso doppio.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
It's the same recipe. The only difference is that the barista

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
uses a bigger cup, usually the one for cappuccino, to capture

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
espresso shots from both spouts. The benefit is that the price

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
is usually better than if you order two single espressos.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
**Americano**: Basically a diluted espresso.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
For those who prefer less intense coffee, you can expect it to be served in a cappuccino cup.

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
The barista adds around 100 to 120 milliliters of water and then pulls an espresso shot.

02:07.000 --> 02:19.000
Coffee retains the flavor characteristics of espresso, but the intensity is milder.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
**Lungo**: A longer espresso, which you can produce by adjusting the grinder and running a longer shot.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
It's usually 30 to 40 grams, or as Tommy does at Beca, by adding extra hot water next to a regular espresso

02:30.000 --> 02:38.000
so that the customer can dilute it to their preferred taste.

02:38.000 --> 02:50.000
**Filter Coffee**: The last black coffee alternative is filter coffee or batch brew.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
It doesn't really fit this topic since it doesn't come from an espresso machine, but it's a fine option for somebody

02:56.000 --> 03:05.000
who wants to drink a big cup of black coffee. The flavor is usually more refined, less intense, and develops as the coffee cools.

03:05.000 --> 03:14.000
Now, most orders at coffee shops actually go for milk-based coffees. Let’s dive into those.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
**Cappuccino**: Arguably the most popular coffee drink in the world.

03:20.000 --> 03:27.000
It consists of a single shot of espresso and foamed milk. Ratios and cup sizes vary but typically range from 150 to 200 milliliters.

03:27.000 --> 03:38.000
Great latte art reflects barista skill and can brighten your day.

03:38.000 --> 03:50.000
**Espresso Macchiato**: A small espresso drink served in an espresso cup, mixing a single shot with a small amount of foamed milk. Ratio is around 1:1 or 1:2.

03:50.000 --> 04:11.000
**Cortado (or Piccolo)**: Often served in a glass, it mixes a single espresso with foamed milk in a 100-120 milliliter cup.

04:11.000 --> 04:40.000
**Flat White**: A popular drink from Australia and New Zealand. It combines a double espresso with foamed milk in a small cappuccino-sized cup for a stronger flavor.

04:40.000 --> 05:06.000
**Café Latte**: Served in a larger cup (around 300 milliliters), it blends a single espresso with lots of foamed milk. Ratio is about 1:14.

05:06.000 --> 06:41.000
To summarize: Espresso-based drinks range from intense single shots to milk-forward café lattes, with a variety of flavor intensities to suit different preferences.

06:41.000 --> 07:31.000
